# ARlog: 
# Post-hoc Inspecting of AR Apps

## Challenges in Testing Augmented Reality Apps
Testing and debugging AR applications is quite tricky and time-consuming because 
* simulators do not provide world capturing through camera, therefore 
* you have to run tests of AR apps on real devices (e.g., on mobile devices or AR glasses);
* walking around with your smartphone or tablet moves your focus away from the console output of your IDE (wheather handicapped by a USB cable or free moving wirelessly doesn't really matter);  
* wearing an AR display on your head while testing code makes testing not easier;
* due to constant change in the real world (light conditions, device position & movement) test results in AR apps are not reproducable (e.g., recognized features are never the same between sessions),
* therefore automatic testing (e.g., with unit tests) is not possible,
* this puts pressure on application testing, but  
* studying user behavior and user experiences during usability tests is hardly possible without mirroring the screen  


## ARlog for AR Session Logging and Screen Recording
ARlog provides the functionality for post-hoc inspecting of AR applications by logging what is going on at runtime in your AR program. During an AR session low-level events of the ARKit framework are automatically collected and the screen is recorded as video. 
### ARlog for ARKit 
ARlog is easy to integrate into existing projects based on ARKit. To install ARlog follow these 3 steps: 
1. Add two files to your project
  * __ARlog.swift__
  * __ARlogItems.swift__
  2. Add one line of code in viewDidAppear of the ViewContoller to start ARlog. Add __ARlog.start()__ such as:
```swift
    override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewDidAppear(animated)
        #if DEBUG
        ARlog.start() // <-- add
        #endif
    }
```
3. Add an additional line of code to stop ARlog. Add __ARlog.stop()__ in one of these cases:

If your AR app only shows an AR view, then stop logging in the AppDelegate with
```swift
    func applicationDidEnterBackground(_ application: UIApplication) {
        #if DEBUG
        ARlog.stop() // <-- add
        #endif
    }
```

If your app presents several views then stop logging when the AR view disappears. In the ViewContoller add:
```swift
    override func viewDidDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewDidDisappear(animated)
        #if DEBUG
        ARlog.stop() // <-- add
        #endif
    }
```
That's it! It already works and session logs of your AR app can post-hoc be analyzed. 

Use XCode to get access to the logged data on your device:
* Connect your device via USB cable to your Mac
* Then select the Window -> Devices and Simulators menu in XCode
* In the Devices tab select your app and then download the app container
* In the Finder right-click on the downloaded .xcappdata file and select "Show Package Contents"
* Logged session data can be found in AppData/Documents/ARlogs
* Drag&drop corresponding session folders to a local directory

Each folder in AppData/Documents/ARlogs holds logged data of a specific session. The name of the session folder encodes the date and time when the log recording started. 

### ARlog Upload
ARlogUpdate.swift can be added to an app in oder to automatically upload all ARlog files to a server from where the ARInspector App can download the session log.

### ARInspector for Mac 
The __ARInspector__ app supports the analysis of AR sessions recorded by ARlog. The main features of ARInspector are:
* Play back of logged sessions in real-time or step-by-step
* Charts for CPU usage, memory usage and graphics performance (in fps, frames per second)
* See screen recording as video
* 3D visualization of the synthetic AR world
  * device position and orientation (with viewing direction of device camera)
  * position of the user
  * point cloud of captured feature points (WorldMap)
  * detected planes with their contour
  * anchor points
  * generated 3D geometry added by the app to the scene
* Tree view for inspecting the 3D scene graph
* Keep screen video and 3D view in sync (view in 3D what the device camera looked at) 
* Highlight results of CV and ML in recorded screen video
* List of events in a time-sorted table
* Detailed data on log events and of 3D scene elements in a console
* Device and app info: Device model, OS version, screen size, main memory, app version, ...
* Automatic session analysis as summary report 
* Create and manage issues (failed tests, comments, ideas) within the session timeline


## ARlog Functions
### Auto-Logging of AR activities
ARlog will automatically capture and log basic activities of the ARKit library (feature points, anchors, planes, detected faces, ...), system usage (cpu, memory, fps), as well as the 3D scene elements generated by your AR application.

### Inline Logging Functions
To enhance session logs with application-specific information, additional logging can be added programmatically inline in your code with the following functions.

    ARlog.info(_ str:String) 
    ARlog.debug(_ str:String) 
    ARlog.warning(_ str:String) 
    ARlog.severe(_ str:String) 
    ARlog.text(_ str:String, level:LogLevel = .debug, title:String = "Message") 
    ARlog.data(_ jsonStr:String, title:String = "Data") 
    ARlog.touch(_ at:CGPoint, long:Bool = false, title:String = "") 
    ARlog.scene(_ scene:SCNScene, title:String = "Scene")
    ARlog.map(_ map:ARWorldMap, title:String = "Map")
    
In order to turn off ARlog set ARLOG_ENABLED = false at the beginning of ARlog.swift.
If ARlog statements are embedded in #if DEBUG conditions ARlog will not be linked to the productive release of your app. 

Auto-Logging of 3D scene elements is triggered by changes in the amount of nodes within the scene graph. If the amount of nodes does not change but the scene becomes different (e.g., by changed geometry or by node transformations) then call `ARlog.scene(sceneView.scene)` programmatically.

### Logging of Computer Vision (CV) and Machine Learning (ML) Results
Create protocols of results gained by CV and ML techniques. _relRect_ depicts the relative bounding box rectangle within the screen. In ARInspector results are shown in the log timeline as well as overlay on top of the screen video. 

    // colors as hexcode string e.g., "#RRGGBBAA"
    ARlog.dominantColors(primary:String, secondary:String = "", relRect:CGRect = CGRect(x:0.0, y:0.0, width:1.0, height:1.0)) 
    ARlog.classifiedImage(label:String, confidence:Float, relRect:CGRect = CGRect(x:0.0, y:0.0, width:1.0, height:1.0)) 
    ARlog.detectedImage(label:String, confidence:Float, relRect:CGRect = CGRect(x:0.0, y:0.0, width:1.0, height:1.0)) 

### Automatically Run Test Cases
ARlog supports test cases that are automatically executed during an AR session. In ARInspector failed tests are added as open issues. Create test cases to ARlog with the following function:

    // add test case with assertion to evaluate condition at time (in sec) after session start
    ARlog.test(_ desc:String, assert: () -> Bool, at:Double = atSessionEnd)
    
Add  test cases to ARlog before the session is started. Here an example of some sample test cases:

```swift
    #if DEBUG
        ARlog.test("A horizontal plane detected after 1 second?", assert: { return self.floorAnchor != nil }, at: 1.0)
        ARlog.test("Floor detected after 3 seconds?", assert: { return self.mode != ARState.scanningFloor  }, at: 3.0)
        ARlog.test("Any elements captured?", assert: { return self.elements.count > 0 })
        ARlog.start(sceneView, sessionName: "ARSCNView")
    #endif
```
    

### Configure ARlog
Configure the behavior of ARlog with these setting parameters.

    ARlog.maxSavedSessions = 4 // Amount of stored sessions on device. Olders will be deleted.
    ARlog.autoLogScene:Bool = true // automatic logging of 3D scene
    ARlog.continouslyLogScene:Bool = false // if false scene is only captured when # of nodes changes 
    ARlog.autoLogMap:Bool = true // autolog WorldMaps
    ARlog.autoLogPlanes:Bool = true
    ARlog.autoLogImages:Bool = false // not yet implemented
    ARlog.autoLogObjects:Bool = false // not yet implemented
    ARlog.autoLogFaces:Bool = false 
    // Intervals for auto logging: no autologging when interval = 0.0
    ARlog.cameraInterval:Double = 0.5 // interval for storing camera/device pose
    ARlog.sceneInterval:Double = 0.25 // interval for storing 3D scenes when continouslyLogScene is true
    ARlog.mapInterval:Double = 1.0 // interval for storing AR world map / space map
